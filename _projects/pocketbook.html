        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This is a personal wiki and digital florilegium that stores linked articles, quotes, thoughts, music, and art. 
        <br><br>
        I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript to code this website by hand, 
        as I wanted to greatest degree of latitude to execute my vision, and to keep the site as low-tech and as maintainable as possible.
        <br><br>
        It's a continual work-in-progress, but please feel free to poke around: <a href="https://ailanisl.github.io/">The Pocketbook</a>

        <h1>Problem Space</h1>
        <p>
        With social media overrun by corporate interests that exploit our attention and psychological vulnerabilities for profit, I became disillusioned with the Internet as a whole. 
        <br><br>I didn't come of age in the nascency of the Internet, but rather during the adolescence of social media. And, I had fun on social media: I loved putting my style and tastes on display, curating art images on the Instagram grid, sharing what I am listening to at the moment. 
        <br><br>Yet, it was just the structure of those platforms that felt limiting to creative impulsivity. Everything was so contrived.
        </p>
        <div class="quote-wrapper" style="width: auto; max-width: fit-content; padding: 1.5rem;">
            But a personal website gives one the latitude to do all of the above without the burden of templates. </div>
        <p>I wanted something that supported my personal knowledge database, commonly referred to as a commonplace. I obsessively take notes on things, 
            collect quotes, and log my books in my commonplace notebooks.
        </p>
        <p>The problem was that, being analog, there was no comprehensive index or organizing system. If I wanted to go back to something, I'd have to flip through copious pages and hope my memory was up to the task. </p>
        <p>I had a supplemental Google Keep account to store some of my quotes, and I was impressed by the tagging system and how easily it allowed me to synthesize ideas and make connections between disparate disciplines. </p>
        <p>Notion, Obsidian, other note-taking applications were existent, but the lack of design freedom put me off. I needed to make something myself.  </p>

        <h1 >Solution</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 2rem;">
            A hand-coded website to preserve my commonplace journal. A “pocketbook” that is a knowledge repository and contains my collections of quotes, poems, music, books, in addition to some of my thoughts.
        </p>

        <p>These were pretty common in the early Internet, with websites such as Gwern, Bactra.org, and Piero Scaruffi being popular public knowledge bases. </p>

    <div id="learning-curve" class="project-flex">
        <h1>Critical Learning Curve</h1>
        <p>To do all this, I need to first know how to even start making a website. So, I found a student-taught course (Web Design Decal) through Berkeley, available on Youtube for free. </p>
        <p>And so, I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript in a matter of three weeks. </p>

            <img loading="lazy" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/pocketbook/simple-sites.png" alt="Are.na collection of simple sites" style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;">
            <p>For the visual design of the website, I was inspired by the old internet style, the hand-coded and ambient web, 
              and minimalist UI.  I  wanted a low-tech site and to minimize my use of Javascript, so no fancy animations, 
              no  web-downloaded fonts. But I did want to include images (dithered and svg wherever possible), so it is an aspiring low-tech site.</p>
            <p>I did extensive research (i.e. web-surfing) and mood-boarding to get a sense of what has been done and what is feasible.
               <a href="https://www.are.na/ailani-sato-lim/simple-sites-d6h6m1dgkdq">A collection of simple sites</a> (and their links) I like is available to view on my Are.na (44 blocks at time of writing).</p>

            <div class="indented-text">
              <p>In Figma, I designed hi-fi prototype of the website, with sets of components and their variables. </p>
              <p>I went through lots of different versions for minute elements of the web design (e.g., the recent post cards). </p>
              <p>I wanted something clean and simple, yet offered some bit of creative unexpectedness.</p>

      <h1>Frontend Implementation</h1>
      <p>When I finished the designs I was at a lost as to how to convert those to HTML and CSS. <br><br>
        So I meandered over to <b>Webflow</b>, hand-copied my  Figma designs in there. 
        The structure that Webflow forces you to use  actually made me visualize how I was supposed to copy my prototypes into HTML/CSS. <br><br>
        <b>ChatGPT and AI tools</b> were helpful in getting me unstuck for coding  problems, 
        but I limited my use, as I didn't want to rely on it too much.</p>

        <p>I decided to use <b>Jekyll</b> as a static site generator, and <b>Github</b> to host it. 
          Thanks to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB">Giraffe Academy</a> on Youtube I learned how to navigate the jungle of Jekyll.
          <br><br>
          I learned a lot about the <b>Liquid (template), markdown, and YAML (data serialization) languages</b> just by doing in the process.
