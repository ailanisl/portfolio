        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This is a personal wiki and digital florilegium that stores linked articles, quotes, thoughts, music, and art. 
        <br><br>
        I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript to code this website by hand, 
        as I wanted to greatest degree of latitude to execute my vision, and to keep the site as low-tech and as maintainable as possible.
        <br><br>
        It's a continual work-in-progress, but please feel free to poke around: <a href="https://ailanisl.github.io/">The Pocketbook</a>

        <h1>Problem Space</h1>
        <p>
        With social media overrun by corporate interests that exploit our attention and psychological vulnerabilities for profit, I became disillusioned with the Internet as a whole. 
        <br><br>I didn't come of age in the nascency of the Internet, but rather during the adolescence of social media. And, I had fun on social media: I loved putting my style and tastes on display, curating art images on the Instagram grid, sharing what I am listening to at the moment. 
        <br><br>Yet, it was just the structure of those platforms that felt limiting to creative impulsivity. Everything was so contrived.
        </p>
        <div class="quote-wrapper" style="width: auto; max-width: fit-content; padding: 1.5rem;">
            But a personal website gives one the latitude to do all of the above without the burden of templates. </div>
        <p>I wanted something that supported my personal knowledge database, commonly referred to as a commonplace. I obsessively take notes on things, 
            collect quotes, and log my books in my commonplace notebooks.
        </p>
        <p>The problem was that, being analog, there was no comprehensive index or organizing system. If I wanted to go back to something, I'd have to flip through copious pages and hope my memory was up to the task. </p>
        <p>I had a supplemental Google Keep account to store some of my quotes, and I was impressed by the tagging system and how easily it allowed me to synthesize ideas and make connections between disparate disciplines. </p>
        <p>Notion, Obsidian, other note-taking applications were existent, but the lack of design freedom put me off. I needed to make something myself.  </p>

        <p style="font-size: 2rem;">
            A hand-coded website to preserve my commonplace journal. A “pocketbook” that is a knowledge repository and contains my collections of quotes, poems, music, books, in addition to some of my thoughts.
        </p>

        <p>These were pretty common in the early Internet, with websites such as Gwern, Bactra.org, and Piero Scaruffi being popular public knowledge bases. </p>

        <p>To do all this, I need to first know how to even start making a website. So, I found a student-taught course (Web Design Decal) through Berkeley, available on Youtube for free. </p>
        <p>And so, I learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript in a matter of three weeks. </p>
