<h2>Poster of a Franz Kafka quote about rituals</h2>
<p>Kafka is a guy who can write pithy but brain-turning one-liners.
     I encountered this quote in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Z._Smith">Jonathan Z. Smith</a> paper, and it has stuck with me since.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite short stories, by one of my favorite authors.

     So I decided to make my own:</p>
